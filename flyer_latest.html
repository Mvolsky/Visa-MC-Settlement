    <h1>Maximize Your Visa/Mastercard Settlement Recovery</h1>

    <p>If your business accepted Visa or Mastercard payments between <strong>January 1, 2004</strong> and <strong>January 25, 2019</strong>, you could be eligible for a significant refund. Visa and Mastercard, along with several major banks, were sued in a class-action lawsuit for allegedly violating antitrust laws by fixing interchange fees (also known as swipe fees), which resulted in businesses being overcharged to process credit and debit card transactions. The companies settled the lawsuit, and as part of the settlement, a $5.5 billion fund has been established to compensate affected businesses.</p>

    <h2>The Money is Already Available</h2>
    <p>The litigation is over, and the funds are held in trust. If your business is eligible, you don’t need to worry about further lawsuits—this is just about collecting the money already set aside for affected businesses.</p>

    <h2>Who Can Benefit?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All businesses that accepted Visa or Mastercard payments during the claim period.</li>
        <li>Franchises, retailers, service providers, and businesses of any industry are eligible.</li>
        <li>Businesses that did not opt out of the settlement are included.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Much Can You Recover?</h2>
    <p>Your potential recovery depends on several factors, including the total volume of credit card transactions your business processed during the eligible period. Businesses with significant credit card receivables, regardless of industry, could be eligible to recover hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars. Let us help you maximize your recovery and unlock your full refund potential.</p>
